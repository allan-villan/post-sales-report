# post-sales-report
This Python script uses PySpark to analyze accident report data.

## Considerations:

I chose to take advantage of Google's free cloud-based service Colab to get familiar with PySpark in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### What's included:

- Jupyter Notebook file 
- Python script
- Shell script
- data.csv

### Requirements: 

To use Google Colab, all you need is a Google account!

## Data

The data is in csv format. Here's an example of what the data looks like below...

>1,I,VXIO456XLBB630221,Nissan,Altima,2003,2002-05-08,Initial sales from TechMotors\n

>2,I,INU45KIOOPA343980,Mercedes,C300,2015,2014-01-01,Sold from EuroMotors\n

>3,A,VXIO456XLBB630221,,,,2014-07-02,Head on collision\n

# Results

The make and year that had the most accidents is a 2015 Mercedes
