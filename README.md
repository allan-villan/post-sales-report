# post-sales-report
This Python script utilizes PySpark to analyze accident report data.

## Considerations:

I chose to take advantage of Google's free cloud-based service Colab to get familiar with PySpark in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### What's included:

The Python script is accompanied by a shell script in the event an event streaming platform is present.

### Requirements: 

There are no requirements to use Colab! Just use a Google account and get started.
