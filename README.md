# post-sales-report
This Python script utilizes PySpark to analyze accident report data.

### Considerations:

I chose to take advantage of Google's free cloud-based service Colab to get familiar with PySpark in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

### What's included:

A Jupyter Notebook file 
A Python script
A shell script in the event an event streaming platform is present.

### Requirements: 

There are no requirements to use Colab! Just use a Google account and get started.

# Data

The data is in csv format. Here's an example of what the data looks like below...

# Results

After performing the script, it seems that the make and year that had the most accidents is a 2015 Mercedes
